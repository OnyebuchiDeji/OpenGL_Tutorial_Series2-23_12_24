/**
    Here, the  colorBuffer or texture that was rendered to off-screen
    is taken and then sampled from and put on the screen.

    So it is an indirect drawing.
    Advantage is that one can modify this separate texture buffer in more
    ways than if one rendered the texture directly to the main Screen Buffer

    For example, one can do Edge Filters, look at points' neighbours...
    and even add black and white.
    One can warp things around and put effects on the screen etc.
